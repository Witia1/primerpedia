## Contribution guidelines

**Primerpedia** is a community project and welcomes contributions of any type: code, documentation, bug reports, etc.

One of the main goals of the project is to remain simple, well documented
and easy to experiment with directly in the browser, without setting up a server.

### Instructions for contributors

- By contributing to this repository, you agree to license your contributions
  under the terms of the project's [open source license (ISC)]().

- If you're contributing prose / documentation, make sure to break lines following the
  [semantic linefeeds](http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/) principle.

### Instructions for maintainers

- Strive to be welcoming to contributors: be patient, avoid excessive nitpicking,
  and in general use language that conveys a sense of common ownership of the project.

- Pull requests should normally be merged using the
  [semi-linear workflow](http://www.bitsnbites.eu/a-tidy-linear-git-history/).
  This means rebasing the PR on top of the latest `gh-pages` branch, and merging with `--no-ff`.
  If no commits have been made to `gh-pages` since the commits in the PR,
  then the "Merge" button of GitHub's web interface can be used to do this.

- Returning contributors should be given collaborator status in the repository.
  This ensures the long-term viability of the project, as people's availability will naturally change over time.
  As a rule of thumb, this should be done once the second pull request is merged.
